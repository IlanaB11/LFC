YML Header: Yet Another Markdown Language Use Source to view document as a markdown file - Visual make it look like render

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** (\*\* or \_\_ for **bold** and \* or \_ for *italic*) button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

Embedded with: ''' {language} - good way to combine R and Python

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

Use the echo command to remove the display of the code

A comment w/ instructions for quarto (hash-pipe #\|)

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `#| echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed). You can also use ``` #|``include: False ``` to run code without showing the output ``` #|``eval: False ``` To show code without running it - good to show errors. (The space between `#|` and the command is necessary.

Use \` around code to get "typewriter effect"

Insert new code block with Insert: Executable Cell

Rendering does not work unless libraries are in the doc - starts from a new session

Load `tidyverse` but silence the message

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
glimpse(penguins)
```

**Never** Include interactive commands (ex/ `View` or `install.packages`) in a Quarto document

## Box Plots

Make a box plot showing `bill_len` by `species`

```{r}
#| warning: false
ggplot(penguins, aes(
  x = bill_len, 
  y = species
)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme_minimal()

```

Error from NA values: Silence with `#| warning: false`

Still admit that missing data is dropped - self written warning: Ex/ Two observation were missing data and should be investigated
