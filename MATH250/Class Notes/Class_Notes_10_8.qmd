Include footnotes like this^[footnote]. Use this to cite the tidy tuesday source as well as two additional sources for the project. 

### Project planning 

1) Generate __lots__ of ideas: make a lot of plots and summaries but also learn more about the data and about color. Think about these

2) Remove ideas that are too difficult or too basic and start doing some further exploring into your top ideas. 

### Pivoting 

`pivot_longer` handles columns that have names that are actually an unamed variable. consider `billboard` as an example. Convert the `wk` column using `pivot_longer`

```{r}

billboard_tidy <- billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("wk"), 
               names_to = "week", 
               values_to = "rank", 
               values_drop_na = TRUE, 
               names_prefix = "wk", 
               names_transform = as.numeric)
```

### Splitting combined cells 
When I column contains more than 1 variable. The simplest tool is `separate`.
