## Revisiting Scooby 

When looking at `setting_terrain` vs another variable make sure that you consider `NA`s

```{r}
#| label: Count NAs
sum(is.na(scooby$setting_terrain))
sum(is.na(scooby$arrested))
```
144 out of 549 rows of `arrested` are `NA`. Why? 

```{r}
#| label: Observe arrested NAs
missing_arrested <- scooby %>% 
  filter(is.na(arrested))
```

Most of the missing values come from specific shows. Some like Laff-A-Lymics did not have a villain to arrest.
