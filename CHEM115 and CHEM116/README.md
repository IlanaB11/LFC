# Course Description
An introduction to and study of the fundamental concepts and principles of chemistry. <br> <br>
CHEM 115 covers atomic and molecular structure, periodic relationships, chemical bonding, stoichiometry. Properties and theories of gases, liquids, and solids. Laboratory introduces quantitative measurements and computer applications. <br><br> 
CHEM 116 covers thermodynamics and kinetics; chemical equilibria; acids, bases, and buffers; coordination compounds; descriptive chemistry of metals and nonmetals. Laboratory is both quantitative and descriptive and uses much instrumentation.
