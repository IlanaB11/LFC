# Course Description 
This course is an introduction to both microeconomics and macroeconomics. Students are introduced to the analytical tools and techniques used by economists to better understand the choices economic agents make and how markets function. The study of microeconomics includes consumer theory, producer behavior, and analysis of market structure. The study of macroeconomics includes the determination of aggregate production, employment and inflation, as well as fiscal policy, monetary policy, the distribution of income, and economic growth. The theories presented are applied throughout the semester to issues facing the U.S. and world economies.
