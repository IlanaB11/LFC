# Course Description 
The study of the structure and reactivity of carbon-containing compounds. <br><br> 
CHEM 220 discusses the physical properties, and chemical transformations of organic compounds, placing a special emphasis on the development of a systematic rational to account for these properties and reactions. The lecture for this course focuses on organic functional groups, nomenclature, resonance, inductive and steric effects, stereochemistry, substitution, elimination, and addition reactions. Laboratory focuses on microscale synthetic techniques, infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies, and gas chromatography. <br><br>
CHEM 221 expands on the systematic understanding of organic compounds and reactions developed in CHEM 220. The lecture focuses on ethers, aromaticity, pericyclic reactions, carbonyl chemistry, polymers, and organometallic reactions. Laboratory focuses on microscale organic synthesis, infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies, gas chromatography, and mass spectrometry.
