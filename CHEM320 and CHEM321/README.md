# Course Description 
CHEM 320 covers quantum mechanics and the nature of the chemical bond. Emphasis on understanding atomic orbitals, atomic and
molecular energy, and the chemical bond. Applications of molecular quantum mechanics; spectroscopy and
computational chemistry. Laboratory focuses on experiments that led to the development of quantum mechanics,
molecular modeling, and spectroscopy. Three class meetings, one laboratory per week. 

CHEM 321 covers the energy and dynamic behavior of groups of molecules. Emphasis on non-ideal gases, statistical mechanics,
thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, and reaction-rate theory. Laboratory focuses on kinetics and thermodynamics
with a culminating independent project-based experience.
